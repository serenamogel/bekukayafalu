He grew up around professional baseball as a fixture in the clubhouses with his father and even attended batting practice at times. When he was just 12 years old, Prince hit a home run into the upper deck of Tiger Stadium off of Tigers third base coach Terry Francona.</p><p>Prince Fielder went to Saint Edward’s School in Vero Beach, Florida, where he played junior varsity baseball. He then attended Florida Air Academy High School before transferring to Eau Gallie High School. He was named the All-Space Coast Player of the Year in 2002 by Florida Today after hitting .524 with 10 home runs and 41 RBI in his senior season.</p><p>About his career, Fielder was selected with the seventh overall pick in the first round of the 2002 MLB Draft by the Milwaukee Brewers. He started his career in the minors and made his big-league debut with the Brewers on June 13, 2005. He bounced between the minors and majors some more that year, and then in 2006 became the Brewers starting first baseman. Fielder broke the record for most home runs by a rookie and became the youngest player in National League history to hit 50 home runs. He was the first Brewer to win the Home Run Derby and became one of a select few players to win more than one Home Run Derby. Fielder was the first player to win the Derby as both an American League and National League All-Star.</p><p>Fielder played the first seven years of his career in Milwaukee before signing with the Detroit Tigers in 2012. In November 2013, he was traded to the Rangers where he spent the rest of his career. A second neck surgery within three years would end his career, and he was released by Texas in 2017.</p><p>He ended his career with 319 home runs, the same number as his father, and a batting average of .283 with 1,028 runs batted in. Fielder is a member of the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqmpoqaTmnqntcSlm56qo2KuuK3RnapmmZ6Zeqm7zaiprGWRobluxc6uZKedlZl6tbuMpKWor18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sue-aikens-bio-net-worth-age-husband-weight-loss-movies.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sue Aikens Bio: Net Worth, Age, Husband, Weight loss, Movies,</a>
