This indicates that it is suitabille for viewers aged 12 and older. However, the rom-com doesn’t shy away from showing adult content.</p><p>The Prime Video content advisory section reads that the movie contains nudity, alcohol use, smoking, foul language, and adult content.</p><p>As the film is released exclusively on streaming platforms and did not have a theatrical run in UK cinemas, its rating is determined by Prime Video rather than by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that in&nbsp;March of this year, both organizations declared an “enhanced collaboration.”</p><p>Interestingly, the movie has been given an R-rating by the Motion Pictures Association in the United States, indicating that viewers under the age of 17 should only watch it when accompanied by an adult.</p><figure></figure><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-red-white-and-royal-blue-rated-r></span>Why is Red White and Royal Blue rated R?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Red White and Royal Blue is rated R because of its inclusion of strong language, certain mature themes, and instances of partial nudity.</p><p>In light of these elements, parents are strongly encouraged to consider this rating when making viewing decisions for their children.</p><p>Speaking to Attitude, director&nbsp;Matthew Lopez&nbsp;shared, “Part of me was surprised at the R-rating, and part of me wasn’t”.</p><p>“I question if it had been a man and a woman, would we have got an R-rating for that scene? More importantly, if it had been a scene about violence, instead of love, would it have got an R rating or a PG 13 rating?” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqwuMNmmKudXam1pnnCoZirmZOpsrO%2FjKKlZqqVmXq4tMitnGaZnpl6s7vYmqNmmpyqsnA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./only-yesterday-2016.html>&#171;&nbsp;Only Yesterday movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2016)</a>
