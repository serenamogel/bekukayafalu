In order to stay on top of dust and debris, I run my iRobot Roomba multiple times every week. The cover of the rug is removed and placed in the washing machine when you are ready to wash it.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In addition, what is the return policy for Wayfair.com?</h3><p>According to the Wayfair returns policy, if you are dissatisfied with your purchase, you can return it to them for a refund within 30 days of delivery, provided that it is in its original condition and packaging.</p><p></p><h3>Furthermore, how can I get my carpet back to you?</h3><p><b>Step-by-step instructions on how to pack a rug for return</b></p><p>In order to return an item, please contact us for a Return Authorization Number (RMA #) and return address.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Using twine, coil the rug from end to end, neatly into a tight roll and secure with a knot (do not apply tape to the rug).</p><p>Place the rug into the original packaging material, if it is still in good condition, and remove any existing shipping labels before placing it in the box.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to put my Ruggable in the dryer?</h3><p>Machine wash our standard woven covers on the permanent press setting or on a regular cycle with cold water using the permanent press setting. Dry the covers on a medium heat setting in the dryer. Dry the shag cover on a medium heat setting in the dryer.

Ruggable rugs, on the other hand, are a good choice if you want a rug that is simple to clean, lightweight, and low profile.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-150 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to wash a rug that is 5×7 in a washing machine?</h3><p>Yes, in a way. Technically. Rugs made of cotton or synthetic fibres, as well as those with a rubber, non-slip backing, can be washed in the washing machine, according to Good Housekeeping.</p><p></p><h3>How much time does it take to become Ruggable?</h3><p>Ruggable rugs are made-to-order, and once an order has been processed, it can take up to 2-3 weeks to ship within the United States, and up to 3-4 weeks to ship internationally. If possible, please allow an extra 1-2 days during sales and holidays.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-151 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to wash Ruggable pads?</h3><p>See this page for information on how to initiate a return. Our patented 2-piece Rug System is comprised of a Rug Cover and a Rug Pad, both of which are sold separately. Machine washable: This item is suitable for use in a standard-sized washing machine. The fabric is stain and water resistant because it is made of polyester and coated with a polyurethane water-resistant barrier.</p><p></p><h3>Is it possible to use Ruggable on carpet?</h3><p>Even if it is placed over carpet, particularly thick and plush carpet, it will not be heavy enough to remain in place. A few people use them over low pile carpet or on carpet but under a table to keep the table in place while they’re working.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is it possible to use Ruggable rugs outside?</h3><p>RUGGABLE rugs maintain their appearance of cleanliness and freshness while also protecting your floors. Because these are indoor/outdoor rugs, you can use them anywhere, including outside your front door or on your patio.</p><p></p><h3>What is a Ruggable Rug, and how does it work?</h3><p>In addition to a nonslip Rug Pad, Ruggable offers a 2-piece Rug System that includes a removable, water-resistant and stain-resistant Rug Cover.
