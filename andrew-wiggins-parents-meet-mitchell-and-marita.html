who currently plays as a small forward for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA).</strong></p><p>He was born on February 23, 1995, in Toronto, Canada, to former NBA player Mitchell Wiggins and former Canadian Olympic track and field sprinter Marita Payne-Wiggins.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Wiggins</a> began playing basketball at a young age and quickly showed a natural talent for the game. He attended Vaughan Secondary School in Ontario, where he led his high school team to an undefeated season and the provincial championship in his senior year. His impressive performances caught the attention of many college basketball coaches in the United States, and he ultimately committed to playing for the University of Kansas.</p><p>During his time at Kansas, Wiggins established himself as one of the top players in the country. He earned several awards and accolades, including the Big 12 Freshman of the Year and the First-Team All-Big 12 honors. His strong performances in college made him a highly sought-after prospect in the 2014 NBA draft.</p><p>Wiggins was selected as the first overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers but was immediately traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves as part of a trade deal for Kevin Love. In his rookie season, Wiggins averaged 16.9 points, 4.6 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game and was named the NBA Rookie of the Year.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Wiggins</a> continued to improve in his subsequent seasons with the Timberwolves, and in 2017, he signed a five-year, $148 million contract extension with the team. However, despite his strong individual performances, the Timberwolves struggled to make the playoffs, and Wiggins was eventually traded to the Golden State Warriors in 2020.</p><p>Since joining the Warriors, Wiggins has continued to be a key contributor to the team’s success. He has shown versatility on both ends of the court, with his ability to score from a variety of positions and defend multiple positions. His strong performances have helped the Warriors remain competitive in the highly competitive Western Conference.</p><p>Off the court, Wiggins is known for his philanthropic work and dedication to social justice issues. He has supported several organizations, including the Boys and Girls Club and the Covenant House, and has been vocal about issues such as police brutality and racial inequality.</p><p>Overall, Andrew Wiggins’ natural talent and hard work have made him one of the top basketball players in the world. His strong performances both on and off the court have earned him a reputation as a role model and leader in the basketball community. With many years of playing ahead of him, it is clear that Wiggins will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in the NBA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Andrew Wiggins Parents: Meet Mitchell and Marita</h2><p>Andrew Wiggins was born to parents Mitchell Wiggins and Marita Payne-Wiggins. Both of his parents have a strong background in basketball.</p><p>Mitchell Wiggins was a former NBA player who played for teams such as the Chicago Bulls, Houston Rockets, and Philadelphia 76ers during his career. He was also a member of the Canadian national basketball team in the 1980s.</p><p>Marita Payne-Wiggins was a track and field athlete who represented Canada in the Olympics. She won two silver medals in the 4×400 meter relay at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Wiggins’ parents met while they were both attending Florida State University on athletic scholarships. They married in 1988 and had their first child, Nick, in 1991. Andrew is their second child.</p><p>In 2002, when Andrew was seven years old, his family moved to Vaughan, Ontario, where his father coached basketball at a local high school. Wiggins grew up playing basketball with his brothers and was heavily influenced by his parents’ athletic backgrounds.</p><p>Throughout his basketball career, Wiggins has credited his parents with helping him develop his skills and passion for the game. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, he said, “My mom and dad have always been there for me, teaching me the game, teaching me how to be a good person.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqlnaqVrHq4tcagoKerXaWus7HNrapmpZWawW65yK2aoZ2coXqiusNmpJqqmamucA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./did-sandman-die-at-the-end-of-spider-man-3.html>&#171;&nbsp;Did Sandman die at the end of Spider-Man 3?</a>
