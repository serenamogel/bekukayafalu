She was born during her mother’s marriage to music executive Robert Ellis Silberstein but her parents divorced in 1977 when she was five years old. She is yet to exchange marriage vows or have children but this doesn’t seem to change her positive views about life in general.</p><h2><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross Has Never Been Married</strong></h2><p>Known for her roles in television shows like Black-ish and Girlfriends, Tracee is a veteran in the movie industry and has been acting since 1996. With her fame, talent, and good looks, there is no doubt that she has admirers who would love to settle down with her but the Black-ish star has not found anyone befitting to share her life with.</p><p>During her <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">interview with Harper’s Bazaar</a> about marriage and family life, she said: “And I would still love [a wedding], but what am I going to do, just sit around, waiting? Shut up. I’ve got so many things to do.”</p><p>She is apparently not averse to the idea of marriage and has not entirely ruled it out from her life. Tracee is just bidding her time while getting busy with other activities going on around her. Aside from her regular acting stints, she runs her own hair-care brand, Pattern Beauty, designed for naturally curly hair. She finds ways to be comfortable in her decision to remain single at her current age.</p><h2><strong>Does Tracee Have Kids?</strong></h2><p>In addition to not being married, Tracee Ellis doesn’t have children of her own as well. Nevertheless, she is surrounded by kids from her very large family.</p><p>Tracee is a proud aunt to her siblings’ children and they love her right back. Her social media pages are also filled with pictures and memories of her nieces and nephews. It goes to say that she is not missing out on anything and she loves her life the way it is.</p><h2><strong>Inside Tracee Ellis Ross’ Large Family</strong></h2><p>Tracee Ellis may not have children but she comes from a large family with a lot of kids to shower her love on. Through her parents, Diana Ross and Robert Ellis Silberstein, Tracee has one biological sibling, Chudney Ross. However, she is Diana’s second child as the singer had her first daughter, Rhonda Ross Kendrick, a few months into her marriage to Robert, but the father of the child is Motown boss, Berry Gordy.</p><p>Robert adopted Rhonda from birth and raised her as his own. Both Rhonda and Chudney now have their own kids named, Raif-Henok Emmanuel Kendrick and Callaway Lane respectively. Diana and Robert were married from 1971 to 1977 before the union ended.</p><p>Unlike Robert who never remarried, Diana went on to marry Norwegian businessman Arne Næss Jr. in 1985. She became the stepmother of her second husband’s three children; Katinka, Christoffer, and folk singer Leona Naess. Diana’s marriage to Arne Næss Jr. produced two sons – Ross Arne and Evan Olav Ross-Næss.</p><p>In addition to the niece and nephew mentioned above, Tracee has five more. Leif (born on June 5, 2016) and Indigo (born 2017), are the sons of her half-brother, Ross Næss. Jagger Snow (born in 2015), and grandson Ziggy (born in 2020) are the children of her other half-brother, Evan. Tracee’s sister, Chudney also has another daughter named Everlee (born October 2019).</p><p>Tracee Ellis’s large family is filled with great talents who have made waves in the entertainment industry but this did not make her venture into the entertainment industry any easier. Tracee still had her own struggles at the budding stage of her career before her breakthrough in Girlfriends and Black-ish.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmraqlqbVurcGorK1lpKeupLHEZpylpJmoerO70qxkn5mdnrm6ecuinZ5lnZa%2Fs7XAoJxmmZ6Zeqy1w6xm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./alabama-charlee-russell-missing-found.html>&#171;&nbsp;Alabama Charlee Russell Missing Update: Is She Found Yet?</a>
