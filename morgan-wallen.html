Peter, Paul, and Mary held the previous record, which dates back to the early 1960s, for their self-titled album.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But Wallen wasn’t resting on the success. In May 2022, he released the single “You Proof.” The song became Wallen’s top chart performer, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. “Thought You Should Know” debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 that same month and reached a high point of No. 7 almost a full year later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By then, Wallen had already released his 36-track album <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B0BT43Y8SS data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="One Thing at a Time" data-vars-ga-product-id=69117b8a-64ae-4b15-85ef-2e0c11d1d260 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B0BT43Y8SS data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B0BT43Y8SS data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/music/player/albums/B0BT43Y8SS data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1a7bed62-05f2-42c6-9785-3bb60640f5be class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">One Thing at a Time</a> and embarked on a (since-extended) 65-show world tour. The March 2023 album was an immediate success, quickly topping the Billboard 200 and placing the song “Last Night” atop the singles chart. Four other songs—“You Proof,” “Thought You Should Know,” “Thinkin’ Bout Me,” and the title track—simultaneously reached the top 10, making Wallen accountable for half of it. Only Taylor Swift, The Beatles, 21 Savage, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/drake data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Drake class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Drake</a>, and Juice WRLD had accomplished the feat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unsurprisingly, Wallen won the Academy of Country Music Award for Male Artist of the Year in May 2023. Months later, in September, he was nominated for three CMA Awards: Entertainer of the Year, Male Vocalist of the Year, and Album of the Year for One Thing at a Time.</p><h2 title="Racial Slur and Other Controversies" data-anchor-id=racial-slur-and-other-controversies class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Racial Slur and Other Controversies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Wallen has generally made headlines for his music, the singer has also gained notoriety for several offstage incidents. He was arrested in May 2020 on charges of public intoxication and disorderly conduct following an incident at a bar and steakhouse owned by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/kid-rock data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kid Rock" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kid Rock</a> in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In October 2020, Wallen was scheduled to be the musical guest on an episode of the sketch comedy show <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/lorne-michaels-saturday-night-live-origins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Saturday Night Live" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Saturday Night Live</a>. But in the days leading up to the performance, videos emerged on social media showing Wallen drinking shots, kissing fans, and failing to follow social distancing guidelines after a football game at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Because of show protocols instituted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, SNL replaced Wallen with The White Stripes frontman Jack White. Wallen owned up to his behavior and, two months later, made fun of himself and the incident during his rescheduled appearance on the show in a skit with actor <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/jason-bateman data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jason Bateman" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jason Bateman</a>.</p><img alt="morgan wallen smiling and singing during a segment with snl actors" title="Morgan Wallen and Jason Bateman appear on Saturday Night Live" width=3000 height=2002 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jason-bateman-episode-1792-pictured-pete-davidson-musical-news-photo-1695409235.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Then, in February 2021, TMZ posted a video of Wallen calling his friend the N-word and using other profanities outside his Nashville home following a night out with friends. Wallen quickly apologized for using the slur, but some radio stations and streaming services dropped him from their playlists. He was also disqualified from the 2021 ACM Awards and temporarily dropped by his label, Big Loud.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That July, Wallen gave <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/morgan-wallen-speaks-racial-slur-gma-interview-michael-78989332 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="his first interview following the incident to ABC’s " class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">his first interview following the incident to ABC’s </a><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/morgan-wallen-speaks-racial-slur-gma-interview-michael-78989332 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Good Morning America" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Good Morning America</a> and said he didn’t mean to use the term in a derogatory manner. “I was around some of my friends, and we say dumb stuff together. In our minds, it’s playful. That sounds ignorant, but that’s really where it came from. And it’s wrong,” Wallen said, adding that he and his friends had been drinking leading up to the exchange. Wallen said he had donated $500,000 from his album sales—which spiked following the backlash—to organizations such as the Black Music Action Coalition and spent a month in rehab in San Diego. “I spent some time... you know, just trying to figure it out… why am I acting this way? Do I have an alcohol problem? Do I have a deeper issue?” he explained.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wallen disappointed fans in April 2023 when he canceled a show at the University of Mississippi minutes before taking the stage because he had lost his voice. A couple of weeks later, the singer revealed doctors had ordered him to go on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a43845374/morgan-wallen-2023-tour-postponed data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="extended vocal rest" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">extended vocal rest</a> because of injured vocal cords and vocal fold trauma. He subsequently canceled six weeks of shows on his One Night at a Time World Tour.

Metro Nashville Police charged the singer with three felony counts of reckless endangerment and one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct. His next court date is scheduled for May 3.</p><h2 title="Personal Life and Son" data-anchor-id=personal-life-and-son class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Personal Life and Son</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wallen reportedly began dating Katie “KT” Smith in 2017. The pair dated off and on through 2019, even becoming engaged, but ultimately split. They share a son, Indigo Wilder.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Indigo, or “Indie,” was born in July 2020 in Nashville, Tennessee. Although the singer and Smith had split by that point, Wallen has said the two do their best as co-parents. His parents also traveled from their home in Tennessee to help care for Indigo. “I just hope to give him as sound advice as my parents gave me and show him love and let him know that I’m here for him and that I’m his friend,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/parents/morgan-wallen-coparents-son-kt-smith-someone-i-care-about/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wallen told People" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Wallen told People</a> in January 2021.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 2023, Indigo was taken to the hospital after being bitten in the face by Smith’s dog, Legend. He received stitches but was okay, according to Smith, who looked to re-home the animal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Wallen also quietly dated model and influencer Paige Lorenze starting in 2021.
