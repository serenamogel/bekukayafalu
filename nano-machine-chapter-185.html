He also explained that he was the former Minor Priest of the Demonic Cult, who betrayed the sect and joined the Heavenly Demon Sect. He said that he did so</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Nano-Machine-Chapter-185-release-date.jpg><p>He did so because he learned the truth about the Demonic Cult and its origin. He said that the Demonic Cult was actually a branch of the Heavenly Demon Sect, which was created by the First Heavenly Demon, who was also the ancestor of Cheon Yeo-woon and Cheon Mu-yeong. He said that the First Heavenly Demon was a genius who mastered the art of nano machines, and used them to create a powerful army of followers. However, he was betrayed by his own son, who stole his nano machines and fled to the Murim world. He then founded the Demonic Cult and spread his teachings to the other sects, while hiding his true identity and motives.</p><p>Cheon Mu-yeong said that he discovered this secret when he found a hidden chamber in the Demonic Cult’s headquarters, where he saw the First Heavenly Demon’s corpse and his nano machines. He also found a message from the First Heavenly Demon, who asked his descendants to return to the Heavenly Demon Sect and restore his legacy. Cheon Mu-yeong said that he decided to follow his ancestor’s will and joined the Heavenly Demon Sect, where he became the leader and the successor of the First Heavenly Demon.

He said that he wanted to use the nano machines to create a new world order, where the Heavenly Demon Sect would rule over the Murim world and the human world. He said that he needed Cheon Yeo-woon’s help to achieve this goal, and asked him to join him and become his son.</p><p>Cheon Yeo-woon was enraged and disgusted by his father’s words. He refused to join him and said that he was his enemy. He said that he loved his mother and the Demonic Cult, and that he would never betray them. He said that he hated his father and the Heavenly Demon Sect, and that he would stop them from destroying the world. He said that he would fight his father and his sect, and that he would protect his friends and his sect.</p><p><strong>Read Also:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nano Machine Chapter 182 Spoiler</a></strong></p><p><strong>Image Source:- Twitter</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGikmqaYrK5wusCnpmalkZi1qrrEZpqhmaCpsrN5kHFsaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./captain-america-the-first-avenger.html>&#171;&nbsp;Captain America: The First Avenger (Movie) Cast</a>
