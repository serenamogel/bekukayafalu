After maintaining a moderate value for over three months, bitcoin finally had its time to amaze crypto investors.<h2>Why is Cardano so cheap?</h2>Why is Cardano so cheap?

In comparison, Cardano is often more affordable for miners, despite Cardano being worth less money. The massive demand for Bitcoin makes it take longer for transactions to work.<h2>Why is Cardano the best?</h2>Cardano is third-generation crypto. Its characteristics offer the best combinations of the first and second-generation cryptos, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It uses Proof of Stake (PoS) instead of Proof of Work (PoW), improving its sustainability compared to other cryptosystems. Experts recommend investing in Cardano.<h2>Whats the future of Cardano?</h2>Although the digital token can currently execute 250 transactions per second, it is expected to reach 1 million transactions per second in the following years. What's in the pipeline for 2022? Cardano's value will increase in the future years as it gains mass usage.<h2>Will Cardano rise in the future?</h2>As crypto markets grow, Cardano will follow.
